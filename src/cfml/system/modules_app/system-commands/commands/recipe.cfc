/**
 * The recipe commands allows you to execute a collection of CommandBox commands
 * usually in a file.boxr recipe file.  CommandBox will iterate and execute each
 * of the commands for you in succession. Lines that start with a # followed by whitespace will be ignored as comments.
 * .
 * {code:bash}
 * recipe myRecipe.boxr
 * {code}
 * .
 * You can also bind the recipe with arguments that will be replaced inside of your recipe.
 * Pass any arguments as additional parameters to the recipe command.
 * Named arguments will be accessible inside the recipe as system settings ${arg1Name}, ${arg2Name}, etc.
 * Positional args will be available as ${1}, ${2}, etc.
 * .
 * Recipe will receive ${name} and ${action}
 * {code:bash}
 * recipe recipeFile=buildSite.boxr name=luis action=create
 * {code}
 * .
 * Recipe will receive ${1} and ${2}
 * {code:bash}
 * recipe buildSite.boxr luis create
 * {code}
 * .
 * System settings which are not found, are replaced with a space.  Remember, you can default then as ${name:default}
 * .
 * You can use "echo on" and "echo off" in recipes to control whether the commands output to the console as they are executed.
 * This can be useful for debugging or confirming the success of commands with no output.  Echo is on by default.
 * Note, "echo off" doesn't suppress the output of the commands, just the printing of the command and its arguments prior to execution.
 * This does not use the actual "echo" command and is a feature that only applies during the execution of recipes.
 *
 * {code:bash}
 * echo on
 * # Now you see me
 * echo off
 * # Now you don't
 * {code}
 *
 * If you have one or more commands to execute which are not contained in a file, but are in a variable or being output
 * from another command, you can simply pass the commands in directly. The your input does not match a file on the
 * file system, the recipe command will attempt to execute your input directly as commands
 *
 * {code:bash}
 * set cmd="package show"
 * recipe ${cmd}
 * env show cmd | recipe
 * {code}
 *
